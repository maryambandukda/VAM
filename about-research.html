<h1>Understanding wayfinding experiences of blind individuals in open spaces</h1>

Hi,
Thank you for your interest in taking part in this questionnaire. My name is Maryam and I'm a first year PhD student at University College London Interaction Centre (UCLIC). My research focuses on experiences of blind individuals in open spaces such as public parks. Before you proceed to the questionnaire, below is some information about my research and what participation will involve. If you choose to participate in further studies, please provide your contact details on the next page and I shall contact you over the next few weeks to discuss your interest. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Thank you for reading this.
<h5><strong>What is the project’s purpose?</strong></h5>
Independent wayfinding is one of the most common challenges faced by blind individuals. Mobility training, guide dogs, and new developments in assistive navigation technology have made wayfinding in urban environments possible. While recent research has investigated how blind people explore indoor spaces and built environment, we know very little about the navigation experiences of blind people in public open spaces such as parks, beaches etc. This project aims to enhance our understanding of how blind individuals navigate these spaces and the impact of positive and negative navigation experiences on their confidence and emotional well-being.

The project includes the following activities in which you may choose to participate.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Interview; </strong>following the questionnaire, if you have given consent to participate in further studies, the researcher will contact you to set up a phone/Skype/face-to-face interview. In the interview, we will ask you questions about your previous experience of going to parks.</li>
	<li><strong>Observation</strong>; the researcher will shadow you on your normal day out to the park or any other public open space. To better understand your experience of going out, we would like to you to wear the <a href="https://www.empatica.com/research/e4/">Empatica E4</a> wristband which records the user’s emotional response. A short interview will follow the observation to allow the researcher to ask questions about the experience. Video of observation and interview will be recorded for analysis.</li>
	<li><strong>Focus Group</strong>; you’ll be invited to attend a half-day group discussion with other study participants about your experiences and accessibility of open spaces. Pictures and audio of the focus group will be recorded for analysis.</li>
	<li><strong>Diary Study</strong>; you’ll share short descriptions of your daily wayfinding experiences with us. These recordings will be anonymised and transcribed for analysis.</li>
	<li><strong>Co-design Workshop: </strong>you’ll be invited to attend a half-day workshop to ideate design concepts and prototype solutions to improve navigation in open spaces.</li>
</ul>
The questions below are relevant if you decide to participate in any of the above activities.
<h5><strong>Will I be recorded and how will the recorded media be used?</strong></h5>
Audio and video recordings of your participation during this research will be used only for analysis and for illustration in conference presentations and lectures. No other use will be made of them without your written permission, and no one outside the project will be allowed access to the original recordings. Transcriptions of audio recordings will be anonymised before being used for analysis and reporting in the form of research papers submitted to conferences and thesis work.
<h5><strong>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</strong></h5>
You may consent to audio/video recording of your participation in the study which will be recorded using a password-protected Apple iPhone device and will be transferred immediately to a password-protected laptop. If required, the data will only be transferred to another password-protected device using a hardware encrypted USB drive. A participant identifier will be assigned to your record upon receiving consent to participate and will be stored with your contact information on a password-protected laptop separate from data collected from the studies.

All data will be handled according to the Data Protection Act 1998 and will be kept anonymous. Only UCL researchers working with Dr. Catherine Holloway will analyse these data. With your permission, we may want to use an extract of the video recording for teaching, conferences, presentations, publications, and/or thesis work. We will use non-anonymized videos only if you have given us written permission. Be aware however, that when we show videos during academic events, people may take videos of our presentations and we do not have control of what they may do with those videos.

If you feel discomfort during participation in the study or prior and would like to withdraw, please bring it to the researcher’s attention immediately.
<h5><strong>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</strong></h5>
Whilst there are no immediate benefits for those people participating in the project, it is hoped that this work will help the HCI research community better understand the experiences of blind individuals in large open spaces such as parks and the implications for designing accessible public spaces for people with visual impairment.
<h5><strong>What if something goes wrong?</strong></h5>
During the course of the project, any concerns or complaints can be reported to UCL in the following ways;
<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:none;">

	<li>For queries/complaints regarding the study, you may contact the Principle Researcher Dr. Catherine Holloway – <a href="c.holloway@ucl.ac.uk">c.holloway@ucl.ac.uk</a></li>
	<li>For concerns regarding data protection - <a href="mailto:data-protection@ucl.ac.uk">data-protection@ucl.ac.uk</a></li>
	<li>If you feel your complaints haven’t been met to your satisfaction you may contact the Chair of the UCL Research Ethics Committee – <a href="mailto:ethics@ucl.ac.uk">ethics@ucl.ac.uk</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential</strong><strong>?</strong></h5>
All the information that we collect about you during the course of the research will be kept strictly confidential. You will not be able to be identified in any ensuing reports or publications.
<h5><strong>Limits to confidentiality</strong></h5>
<ul>
	<li>Please note that confidentiality may not be guaranteed; due to the limited size of the participant sample in focus groups and workshops.</li>
	<li>Confidentiality will be respected subject to legal constraints and professional guidelines.</li>
	<li>Confidentiality will be respected unless there are compelling and legitimate reasons for this to be breached.  If this was the case we would inform you of any decisions that might limit your confidentiality.</li>
	<li>Confidentiality may be limited and conditional and the researcher has a duty of care to report to the relevant authorities possible harm/danger to the participant or others.</li>
</ul>
